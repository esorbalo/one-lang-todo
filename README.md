# One-Lang Todo Application

Boilerplate code to create Backend + Web + Mobile applications entirely on JavaScript. Quick to setup and deploy. Ready to be used in hackatons, proof of concepts or early startups. 


It covers:

* Backend - Postgresql, Authentication through Auth0, ready to be deployed on Heroku
* Web - React, Bootstrap 3, Authentication
* Mobile - React-Native, Expo, Native-Base, React-Navigation, Authentication

This is a spin-off from a private project. 

## Local setup

Each project explains the setup of local environment. Do it in the following order:

1. [backend](backend) - make sure that it starts without any errors.
2. [front-web](front-web) - make sure that the website loads and that it connects to the locally running backend.
3. [front-mobile](front-mobile) - make sure that it runs in the simulator and connects to the locallly running backend.
